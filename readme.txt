Create the configuration json file for the My FastAPP Photo Editor with no programming skills!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create automatically the configuration file for the My FastAPP's Photo Editor feature.

**Simple and easy**
All you have to do is to select the images from the Wordpress Media Library, click a button to get the file URL
and then insert it in the app menu item from your My FastAPP plugin menu page.

You can configure both the Overlay and the Scenario sections:
* add and remove images
* sort the images order by dragging and dropping them


*Updated from a previous version*
In order to re-create the configuration file, it's necessary:
- to deactivate/reactivate the plugin
**OR**
- to click the save data button.
